# CPRD_AURUM_codelist
Codelists for indicators of consultation complexity and minor conditions in primary care (CPRD Aurum)
This repository provides all codelists used to analyse consultation and patient complexity factors, and the health professionals seen in English primary care, using CPRD Aurum data. We developed codelists for 10 consultation complexity indicators and 7 patient complexity indicators based on the measures identified and validated through a Delphi consensus and cross-sectional study (Salisbury et el., 2020. Measuring the complexity of general practice consultations: a Delphi and cross-sectional study in English primary care. British Journal of General Practice. https://bjgp.org/content/early/2021/04/05/BJGP.2020.0486?versioned=true)
Our clinical codelist methodology follows a three-stage process—design, review, and validation—as described by Watson et al. (2017): Identifying clinical features in primary care electronic health record studies: methods for codelist development. BMJ open, 7(11), p.e019637. https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/11/e019637.abstract).
Inclusion or exclusion of each code was determined by consensus ratings from two GP clinicians, Dr Peter Edwards and Dr Mavin Kashyap.
For multimorbidity, we applied the definition of the 20-condition Cambridge Multimorbidity Score (https://www.cmaj.ca/content/192/5/E107). In additional to the 8 long-term condition codelists developed by us, we used the following multimorbidity codelists developed by Dr. Anna Head (available at https://github.com/annalhead/CPRD_multimorbidity_codelists/tree/main): Asthma, Atrial Filbrillation, Chronic Kidney Disease, COPD, CHD, Dementia, Heart Failure, Hypertension, Irritable Bowel Syndrom, Ischaemic Stroke, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Stroke.
Product codes can be access from CPRD AURUM product dictionary.
